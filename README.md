# TODO

## Phase 2
* Big projects monday aren't spread out over weekend appropriately
* Highlight "today"
* Move back and forward weeks
* Line up days (convert to tables?) - shit, this might actually take javascript...
* Preferences (weekends heavy, frontload, backload)
* Rearrange plans (put on different days, split, etc)
* Move to sunday-first :(
* Design
