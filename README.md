# TODO

## Bugs
* Weekend Autoplan: Big projects monday aren't spread out appropriately
* Autoplan doesn't split big projects correctly at all
* Autoplan shouldn't fill in plans for days that have already elapsed
* Don't try to autoplan completed tasks

## v1.0 release milestone
* Highlight "today", gray out previous days?
* Move back and forward weeks
* Line up days (convert to tables?) - shit, this might actually take javascript...
* Move to sunday-first :(
* Print mode
* Design
* Long term tasks
* Show total hours of work on every day?
* Show amount of time each plan represents?
* Improve estimation parsing
* Email reminders for Sunday

## Nice to have
* Email reminders for big projects next week
* "Good job" emails
* Google Cal task import
* Different ways of manipulating plans (put on different days, split, etc)
* Autoplan Preferences (weekends heavy, frontload, backload)?
* Drag tasks between days
* Google calendar availability autoplan integration
* iCal availability autoplan integration
* Alternatively, let users specify the number of free hours you have per day?
* Specific work times for plans?
