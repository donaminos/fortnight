# Project Caberdemo

Meteor version of demoknight

# TODO

## Phase 2
* Weekend Autoplan: Big projects monday aren't spread out appropriately
* Highlight "today"
* Move back and forward weeks
* Line up days (convert to tables?) - shit, this might actually take javascript...
* Preferences (weekends heavy, frontload, backload)?
* Rearrange plans (put on different days, split, etc)
* Move to sunday-first :(
* Design
