# Project Caberdemo

Meteor version of demoknight

# TODO

## Bugs
* Weekend Autoplan: Big projects monday aren't spread out appropriately
* Autoplan doesn't split big projects correctly at all
* Autoplan shouldn't fill in plans for days that have already elapsed

## v1.0 release milestone
* Line up days (convert to tables?) - shit, this might actually take javascript...
* Fine heatmapping intervals
* Move back and forward weeks
* Print mode
* Design
* Improve estimation parsing
* Email schedules for the day, special Sunday reminder

## v1.1 release milestone
* Long term tasks

## Nice to have
* Email reminders for big projects next week
* Different ways of manipulating plans (put on different days, split, etc)
* Autoplan Preferences (weekends heavy, frontload, backload)?
* Drag tasks between days
* Google calendar availability autoplan integration
* iCal availability autoplan integration

## For consideration
* Specific different work times for plans? , OR, let user customize how much each plan should be?
* Show amount of time each plan represents?
* Alternatively, let users specify the number of free hours you have per day?
* Google Cal task import
* "Good job" emails

## Will not do
* Grey out previous days
* Disable previous days
