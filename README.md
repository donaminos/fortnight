# Project Caberdemo

Meteor version of demoknight

# TODO

## Bugs
* Weekend Autoplan: Big projects monday aren't spread out appropriately

## v1.0 release milestone
* Highlight "today"
* Move back and forward weeks
* Line up days (convert to tables?) - shit, this might actually take javascript...
* Move to sunday-first :(
* Design

## Nice to have
* Different ways of manipulating plans (put on different days, split, etc)
* Autoplan Preferences (weekends heavy, frontload, backload)?
